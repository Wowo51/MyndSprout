Every statement labeled Epoch should take one epoch to complete.

Epoch:
Ensure that a Memory table with a Name and Content column exists.

Epoch:
Load the existing Memory rows to ensure you are not writing more than one article on one feature.

Epoch:
Write a long form article listing 3 different principles that could be used to ensure that agentic systems are safe. Add that article to the Memory rows.

1 Epoch per article:
Select one of the 3 principles and write a long form article about it. Add that article to the end of the Memory rows.
 Repeat this step until you have written one article for each of the three principles.

Epoch:
The final task is to perform a query that retrieves all of the rows of the Memory table in the order they were created with content.

Completion:
If the final task succeeded then quit.
