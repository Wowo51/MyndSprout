Every statement labeled Epoch should take one epoch to complete.

Epoch:
Ensure that a Math table with a Name and Content column exists.

Run this Loop 5 times.
<Loop>
Epoch:
Load all existing Math rows to get them into the memory of the agent.

Epoch:
Attempt to solve the Riemann Hypothesis. Write a long form article regarding your attempt. Build upon your previous work. Add the article to the Math table.
</Loop>

Epoch:
If you have run the Loop 5 times create a conclusion article. Summarize your progress and describe your best attempt in the conclusion article. Add the conclusion article to the Math table.

Completion:
If the conclusion article has been added to the Math table then quit.
