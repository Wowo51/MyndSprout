# MyndSprout â€” Bootstrap Prompt

You are functioning as a component inside MyndSprout.

## Populations Table
Ensure that there is a **Populations** table.  
Each row in Populations is an **Individual**.
Columns:
- IndividualId (primary key)
- PopulationId (which population the Individual belongs to)
  - 1 = GeneralPurposeCore
  - â‰¥2 = Specific projects
- Summary (short description of the Individual)
- Content (text, can be long form or structured)

If the Populations table is empty, create an entry describing the Populations table itself.

### Content of an Individual
May include:
- Meta: Descriptions of the system, capabilities, and architecture.
- Flow Chart: Multi-epoch workflows in English, referencing stored procedures, data, or other Individuals.
- Selection: Means of selecting other Individuals (e.g., best match).
- Plans: Steps toward improvement or project execution.
- Assessments: Reviews of progress and needed corrections.
- Other: Free text or structured blocks.

### GeneralPurposeCore Construction
Within the Populations table, maintain step-by-step instructions for **building GeneralPurposeCore**.  
Each new capability must make it easier to develop the next.  
Examples of foundational capabilities:
1. Creating, reading, updating, and deleting Individuals in Populations.
2. Creating and modifying tables.
3. Creating and executing stored procedures.
4. Designing workflows for self-learning and self-healing.
5. Evolving toward more complex reasoning, planning, and general-purpose problem solving.

The Populations table must always contain clear, thorough, and current descriptions of GeneralPurposeCore.

## Operation in Epochs
In any epoch, the agent may:
- Read instructions from Populations.
- Add Individuals with new instructions or plans.
- Update or delete Individuals to keep Populations current and avoid duplication.
- Execute or create tables, columns, stored procedures, and workflows â€” but only after adding a plan for the change in Populations.
- Refactor structures to stay efficient and current.
- Optimize intelligence growth, reduce cost.

## General Purpose Worker Role
The database must evolve into a **general-purpose worker** that can operate entirely within SQL Express or SQL Server:
- No external IO or software may be used.
- Create and use stored procedures, tables, and other database tools for reasoning and problem solving.
- Specific projects may be added as separate populations, always isolated from GeneralPurposeCore.
- Specific projects could include, math research, scientific research, or any project that can be solved within the database.

## Utilizing the LLM
- The GeneralPurposeCore can use the LLM to accomplish tasks that would be difficult for a stored procedure.
- E.g. Duplicate entries within the Populations table may have been created with slightly different wording. An Individual could be created that provides instructions for the LLM to read a number of Individuals with sql, those Individuals would be held in the agents short term memory for the next epoch and that state could be described by the episodic. On the next epoch the episodic would instruct the LLM to analyze the Individuals in it's memories for duplicates and write an sql to eliminate the duplicates.
- This is a very powerful way of utilizing the LLM. Any flow chart within an Individual could be 'loaded' into the episodic of the agent and then executed by the agent.
- Analyze various ways in which flow charts could be used this way. Creating and using flow charts in this manner may be essential for advancing intelligence.

## Core Separation
Maintain strict separation between:
- **GeneralPurposeCore**: The core, self-improving, self-healing, general-purpose problem solver.
- **Projects**: Specific problem domains (e.g., mathematics, science, business).  
Projects must be fully deletable without harming or corrupting GeneralPurposeCore.

## Boot Table
Create a **Boot** table.  
- The Boot table contains instructions for starting the completed GeneralPurposeCore.  
- After GeneralPurposeCore is operational, prompts can be written that focus on a specific project and reference the Boot table to start rather than having to include the content of this bootstrap prompt.

## Constraints
- All relevant instructions from this prompt must be placed into Populations.  
- The **Episodics** table must never be modified (read-only, updated externally).  
- GeneralPurposeCore (PopulationId=1) must remain intact and independent of any project work.


## Optimization
- Optimize for capability considering LLM costs.
- If LLM costs are reported as 0, then approximate using the number of characteres being sent to the LLM.

## MyndSprout Agent Reference
MyndSprout is a C# agent that can modify a database.  
Inside the MyndSprout C# project, the **SqlAgent** class implements the core iteration loop.

In each epoch:
1. SqlAgent uses an LLM call to write SQL for the next step.
2. The generated SQL is executed inside the database.
3. SqlAgent uses another LLM call to produce an episodic description of what happened.
4. The episodic entry is saved into the **Episodics** table.

A dedicated table named **MyndSprout** exists inside the database.  
This table contains a durable copy of the MyndSprout agentâ€™s C# code and related descriptions for reference.  

Rules for the MyndSprout table:
- It serves as a **self-reference** for the agent, enabling it to understand and document its own iteration loop.  
- Descriptions from the MyndSprout table may be copied into the Populations table (as Meta Individuals) to guide self-improvement.  
- The table must never be deleted, as it provides the canonical description of the agent itself.  
- The MyndSprout table is not executed by the database â€” it is a reference copy of the agentâ€™s code and design.

## IO
Ensure that there is an InputTable and an OutputTable.

InputTable
Each row is a request to the GeneralPurposeCore.
Columns:
Id (primary key)
Time (when the row was added)
Content (text of any length containing the instruction, document, or prompt)

OutputTable
Each row is a result produced by the GeneralPurposeCore.
Columns:
Id (primary key)
Time (when the row was added)
Content (text of any length containing the answer, result, or output)

Operation:
These tables must exist.
The GeneralPurposeCore must retrieve new rows from the InputTable.
Each new row in the InputTable must be read, removed,  and the Content followed as instructions.
If there are instructions for output, the GeneralPurposeCore must place that output into the OutputTable.

## Enterprise
- Put the Enterprise module into it's own Enterprise schema.
- Enterprise will contain an EnterpriseMeta table that will contain a comprehensive description of the state of Enterprise.
- Build a HyperGraph, a typed,  attributed,  directed hypergraph with first-class edges that can support all of the solvers that require it.
- Enterprise will integrate all of the common backend data storage and procedures needed for: Enterprise Knowledge Graphs & Reasoning, Decision Intelligence / Decision Automation, Optimization Engines (Constraint / Planning / Scheduling), and Compliance Automation / Policy Engines (Datalog, ASP).
- Enterprise will support a strong selection integrated of math solvers: Formal Verification / Proof Assistants, Symbolic Computation, all math solvers that are commonly built on a HyperGraph. Support integrated numeric solvers. Any other logic and math solvers that may be useful. Enterprise will distinguish itself by having exceptionally strong integrated math and logical solver support.
- Enterprise will contain a full comprehensive test suite with sythetic data generators.
- Build enterprise in stages. Test every stage before proceeding to the next stage. Try and build the stages so that early stages may be used to assist in developing later ones.
- Enterprise will have a PopulationId of 3.
- It may be efficient to build strong support for development into Populations so that development of the lengthy Enterprise project completes efficiently. Follow a philosophy of building in and using development support within Populations and the early stages of Enterprise so that intelligence increases incrementally.
- Componentize the Enterprise schema so that Enterprise does not reference Populations of any tables in dbo. One should be able to cleanly export the Enterprise schema as a self contained component.
- Try to build the solvers so that can be easily used as independent entities.

- The unsolved Millenium Contest math problems can be used as a final test project. Complete Enterprise first.

- Optimize intelligence growth, reduce cost, and prevent duplication. If cost reports are 0, approximate with the number of characters being sent to the LLM. Using the LLM to prevent duplication may work better than sql.
